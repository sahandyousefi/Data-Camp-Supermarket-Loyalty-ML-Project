# Data-Camp-Supermarket-Loyalty-ML-Project
International Essentials is an international supermarket chain.

Shoppers at their supermarkets can sign up for a loyalty program that provides rewards each year to customers based on their spending. The more you spend the bigger the rewards.

The supermarket would like to be able to predict the likely amount customers in the program will spend, so they can estimate the cost of the rewards.

This will help them to predict the likely profit at the end of the year.

Create a cleaned version of the dataframe.

1- You should start with the data in the file "loyalty.csv".

2- Your output should be a dataframe named clean_data.
